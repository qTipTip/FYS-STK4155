  abstract = {This report is concerned with methods for solving the scattered data interpolation problem: Given points (X sub K, Y sub k, F sub k), k = 1, ..., N, construct a smooth function, F(x,y), so that F(X sub k, Y sub k) = F sub k, K = 1, ...,N. A comparison of 29 methods for solution of this problem has been made. Each of the methods is discussed and the results of extensive testing for their properties and appropriate values of their parameters is given. Both local and global methods are considered. Comparisons of timing, storage, accuracy, visual pleasantness of the surface, and ease of implementation are made. A large number (over 200) of pages of perspective plots of surfaces are given. Suggestions for improvement of some methods are made, and methods which have poor approximation properties are identified.},

  abstract = {The linear regression model cannot be fitted to high-dimensional data, as the high-dimensionality brings about empirical non-identifiability. Penalized regression overcomes this non-identifiability by augmentation of the loss function by a penalty (i.e. a function of regression coefficients). The ridge penalty is the sum of squared regression coefficients, giving rise to ridge regression. Here many aspect of ridge regression are reviewed e.g. moments, mean squared error, its equivalence to constrained estimation, and its relation to Bayesian regression. Finally, its behaviour and use are illustrated in simulation and on omics data. Subsequently, ridge regression is generalized to allow for a more general penalty. The ridge penalization framework is then translated to logistic regression and its properties are shown to carry over. To contrast ridge penalized estimation, the final chapter introduces its lasso counterpart.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most exciting and dynamic areas of modern research and application. The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to the core concepts and tools of machine learning in a manner easily understood and intuitive to physicists. The review begins by covering fundamental concepts in ML and modern statistics such as the bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, regularization, generalization, and gradient descent before moving on to more advanced topics in both supervised and unsupervised learning. Topics covered in the review include ensemble models, deep learning and neural networks, clustering and data visualization, energy-based models (including MaxEnt models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines), and variational methods. Throughout, we emphasize the many natural connections between ML and statistical physics. A notable aspect of the review is the use of Python Jupyter notebooks to introduce modern ML/statistical packages to readers using physics-inspired datasets (the Ising Model and Monte-Carlo simulations of supersymmetric decays of proton-proton collisions). We conclude with an extended outlook discussing possible uses of machine learning for furthering our understanding of the physical world as well as open problems in ML where physicists may be able to contribute.

  abstract = {In this paper we describe the use of a novel representation, LR B-spline surfaces, and apply this representation in the treatment of geographical data. These data sets are typically very large and LR B-spline surfaces offer a compact representation of overall smooth data with local details. We briefly describe the properties of the LR B-spline representation, and discuss the details of two approximation methods adapted for LR B-splines: least squares approximation and multilevel B-spline approximation (MBA). The described techniques are demonstrated on several examples of terrain data in the form of point clouds.},
